The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the outcomes of a modified version of the TINT:WSA program, adapted to teach emotion skills directly to early adolescents rather than solely to parents (see Figure~\ref{fig:TINT} for the program logo). This study extends prior research in several ways. Unlike previous implementations that primarily targeted parents with the expectation that they would transfer learned skills to their children through emotion socialization, this study provided direct instruction to adolescents regarding their emotional awareness, emotional understanding, and emotion regulation strategies. The program also addressed the role of emotions within the context of peer and friendship interactions, a particularly salient domain for early adolescents.
